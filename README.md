# hello-world
I was introduced into the world of programming in the early 80s when my father purchased a TI 99 personal computer. I dabbled a bit with basic & DOS but really didn't get very far. In college, I took various programming classes including PASCAL and Fortran but then switched majors and went into business. I have worked in the insurance industry for the last 17 years or so and but recently I have felt the urge to get back into programming. Since becomming really interested in programming so I've taken several courses in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Ruby. I really enjoyed all of the courses but I think I like jquery and Ruby the best. I want to continue to develop my skills as a programmer and software developer so I am here on GITHUB to learn from other programmers and to try to contribute to the community if I can.
