# hello-world
I was introduced into the world of programming in the early 80s when my father purchased a TI 99 personal computer. I dabbled a bit with basic & DOS but really didn't get very far. I various programming classes including PASCAL in college but then switched majors and went into business. I have worked in the insurance industry for the last 17 years or so selling life insurance as well as property and casualty insurance. Lately I have been really interested in programming so I've taken several courses in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Ruby. I really enjoyed all of the courses but I think I like jquery and Ruby the best. I want to continue to develop my skills as a programmer and software developer so I am her on GITHUB learning the processes offered here.
